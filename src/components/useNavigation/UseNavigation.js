          useNavigation() is a hook which gives access to the navigation object
          providing you to navigate between different screens, providing you all
          accessible routes according to the current state of a user ( logged
          state and logged role ). It is also very useful for a component which
          is not directly a route defined in public or private paths because it
          doesn't have access to history prop directly.

          useNavigation() returns an object with the following properties :
