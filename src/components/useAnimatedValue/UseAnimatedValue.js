          useAnimatedValue() is a very flexible and powerful hook that lets you
          define animated values. Its value is preserved until the component
          unmounts and doesnâ€™t change during the state change and re-render of a
          component.

          useAnimatedValue() returns an animated node initialized at
          initialValue. Animated Node is a special type of Node that has value
          property which is automatically animated if initialValue changes at
          some point or if we set its value to some number.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Let us define an animated value called opacity.</Paragraph>
        <Code>const opacity = useAnimatedValue(0)</Code>
        <Paragraph>
          Here we create an animated node called opacity at an initial value
          initial value 0. And opacity has a property called value. At any time
          we set opacity.value to some number then it changes its value from 0
          to that number.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We can change the opacity.value to 1 if a user clicks a button. It
          auto animates the value from 0 to 1.
        </Paragraph>
        <Code>{"onClick = () => (opacity.value = 1)"}</Code>
